IMR -- an ARP table attack program</pre>

<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><strong>IMR</strong> is short for 'In Medias Res'. It is a program that allows you to perform an ARP table 
attack on two hosts, named  <em>client</em> and <em>server</em>. Thus, all traffic from the server to 
the client will be sent to you, as well as all traffic from the client to the server. <strong>IMR</strong>
simply routes all incoming data to the appropriate host and logs it to your disk for further
inspections.</p>
<p><strong>IMR</strong> gives you the ability to check whether your network is secured against ARP
attacks. Furthermore, it allows you to analyze networking protocols in great detail
without changing data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_it_works">HOW IT WORKS</a></h2>
<p>This is what <strong>IMR</strong> does:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_send">Send (forged) ARP replies</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Two ARP replies of the form 'a.b.c.d is at AB:CD:EF:GH' are sent to both the client
and the server, hence ensuring that both hosts consider this PC the current communication
partner.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_read_data">Read data</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Now all incoming data is read. A loop checks whether they originate from the client or from
the server. During this check, the destination address of the current Ethernet frame is set
to the proper MAC address, so that the packets don't get stuck.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_log_data">Log data</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Everything is logged in raw format, i.e. each packet plus all of its payload is written to
the disk. The log file does not look good, but it will allow a complete reconstruction of
each packet.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_reset_the_arp_tables">Reset the ARP tables</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
After the routing has been cancelled, two ARP replies are sent that restore the ARP
table, so that the proper MAC addresses are set.
</dd>
<p></p></dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="why_it_works">WHY IT WORKS</a></h2>
<p>To work properly, ARP needs an ARP table, in which pairs of MAC addresses and IP addresses
are saved. This is why your kernel 'knows' the destination address of the Ethernet frame. Unfortunately,
ARP doesn't check whether packets have been requested or not. So you are able to poison the ARP
table by sending your own ARP replies that say something like 'You will find this IP address at my
MAC address'. There is no possibility for ARP to validate your MAC address / IP address pair,
so it will be added to the table.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="caveats">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p>Please be aware of the fact that <strong>IMR</strong> is a diagnostic application. The code will give
you some information about the <em>Berkeley Packet Filter</em>, <strong>BPF</strong>, but <strong>IMR</strong> is really <em>not</em>
meant as an attack tool of any sort. Even if you are the administrator of your LAN,
you are by no means allowed to capture the data of your users without telling them...</p>
